Helpful resources for Vipassana meditators

## [Pre-sit focus enhancer](pre-sit-focus-enhancer)

This is a presentation (made with the very awesome Deckset) that is designed to improve focus and intent whilst meditating. Taken from my notes across several books and audio guides as well as personal experience, it aims to keep the basics of Vipassana in the forefront of your mind as you sit. It is intended to be read immediately prior to meditating to help you to get the most out of your dedicated time of practice.

As with all things, it is a work in progress and will change and improve with time. If you download the PDF, check back every so often for an improved version. I use iBooks on my iPhone as a reader for this, as it is the least intrusive of those I've seen. Don't forget to turn your phone on silent (or DND or Airplane Mode or all of the above) to ensure you will not be disturbed during meditation.

Happy Sitting!

## [Noble Eightfold Path Poster](eightfoldpath)

I made this poster because I didn't like the look of any of those that a Google search turned up and I wanted something visible on my wall to remind me of all of the steps of the noble eightfold path. I'm not as skilled in Photoshop as my designer, but this turned out good enough for me to offer. It's simple and clean.
